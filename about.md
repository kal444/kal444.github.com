I would like to write more. About programming; about technology; about photography; about gaming; or maybe even about politics.

It's hard to write about myself. I will leave some blanks here for now and fill it in as it happens.

For now, I live in Kansas and lead a pretty normal life. Balancing my enjoyment of the outdoor with an inherent laziness keeps me occupied.
