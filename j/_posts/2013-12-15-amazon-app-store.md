Over Black Friday, I bought a Kindle Fire HDX. Nice little device to along an Amazon prime membership.

Yesterday, I was setting up the device to match what I use on my iPad. Part of this involved buying Instapaper so that I can get my readings done.

Here is how the process went.

On activating the device, Amazon sent me 500 *Amaozn Coins*. This can be used for App store (and others) purchases.

I saw Instapaper costing $2.99

So I spent 299 + 25 (tax) = 324 coins when I purchased it.

This triggered a promotion and returned 250 + 90 = 340 coins to me.

So I actually made 16 coins on this transaction!

I wonder how much is the payout to the author.
